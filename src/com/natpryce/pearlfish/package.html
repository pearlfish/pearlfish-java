        The core Pearlfish API and interfaces that define extension points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tests usually do not use this API directly, but use an adaptor API that uses the extension
        points to adapt the behaviour of the Approver to the needs of a specific test framework.
        For example, the {@link com.natpryce.pearlfish.adaptor.junit.ApprovalRule} class adapts
        Pearlfish to work with JUnit.
